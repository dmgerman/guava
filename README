IMPORTANT WARNINGS
------------------

1. APIs marked with the @Beta annotation at the class or method level
are subject to change. They can be modified in any way, or even
removed, at any time. If your code is a library itself (i.e. it is
used on the CLASSPATH of users outside your own control), you should
not use beta APIs, unless you repackage them (e.g. using ProGuard).

2. Deprecated non-beta APIs will be removed eighteen months after the
release in which they are first deprecated. You must fix your
references before this time. If you don't, any manner of breakage
could result (you are not guaranteed a compilation error).

3. Serialized forms of ALL objects are subject to change. Do not
persist these and assume they can be read by a future version of the
library.
