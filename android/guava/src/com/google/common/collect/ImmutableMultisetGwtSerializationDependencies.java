comment|/**  * A dummy superclass to support GWT serialization of the element type of an {@link  * ImmutableMultiset}. The GWT supersource for this class contains a field of type {@code E}.  *  *<p>For details about this hack, see {@code GwtSerializationDependencies}, which takes the same  * approach but with a subclass rather than a superclass.  *  *<p>TODO(cpovirk): Consider applying this subclass approach to our other types.  *  *<p>For {@code ImmutableMultiset} in particular, I ran into a problem with the {@code  * GwtSerializationDependencies} approach: When autogenerating a serializer for the new class, GWT  * tries to refer to our dummy serializer for the superclass,  * ImmutableMultiset_CustomFieldSerializer. But that type has no methods (since it's never actually  * used). We could probably fix the problem by adding dummy methods to that class, but that is  * starting to sound harder than taking the superclass approach, which I've been coming to like,  * anyway, since it doesn't require us to declare dummy methods (though occasionally constructors)  * and make types non-final.  */
