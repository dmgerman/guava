comment|/**  * A collection that supports order-independent equality, like {@link Set}, but  * may have duplicate elements. A multiset is also sometimes called a  *<i>bag</i>.  *  *<p>Elements of a multiset that are equal to one another are referred to as  *<i>occurrences</i> of the same single element. The total number of  * occurrences of an element in a multiset is called the<i>count</i> of that  * element (the terms "frequency" and "multiplicity" are equivalent, but not  * used in this API). Since the count of an element is represented as an {@code  * int}, a multiset may never contain more than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}  * occurrences of any one element.  *  *<p>{@code Multiset} refines the specifications of several methods from  * {@code Collection}. It also defines an additional query operation, {@link  * #count}, which returns the count of an element. There are five new  * bulk-modification operations, for example {@link #add(Object, int)}, to add  * or remove multiple occurrences of an element at once, or to set the count of  * an element to a specific value. These modification operations are optional,  * but implementations which support the standard collection operations {@link  * #add(Object)} or {@link #remove(Object)} are encouraged to implement the  * related methods as well. Finally, two collection views are provided: {@link  * #elementSet} contains the distinct elements of the multiset "with duplicates  * collapsed", and {@link #entrySet} is similar but contains {@link Entry  * Multiset.Entry} instances, each providing both a distinct element and the  * count of that element.  *  *<p>In addition to these required methods, implementations of {@code  * Multiset} are expected to provide two {@code static} creation methods:  * {@code create()}, returning an empty multiset, and {@code  * create(Iterable<? extends E>)}, returning a multiset containing the  * given initial elements. This is simply a refinement of {@code Collection}'s  * constructor recommendations, reflecting the new developments of Java 5.  *  *<p>As with other collection types, the modification operations are optional,  * and should throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException} when they are not  * implemented. Most implementations should support either all add operations  * or none of them, all removal operations or none of them, and if and only if  * all of these are supported, the {@code setCount} methods as well.  *  *<p>A multiset uses {@link Object#equals} to determine whether two instances  * should be considered "the same,"<i>unless specified otherwise</i> by the  * implementation.  *  *<p>Common implementations include {@link ImmutableMultiset}, {@link  * HashMultiset}, and {@link ConcurrentHashMultiset}.  *  *<p>If your values may be zero, negative, or outside the range of an int, you  * may wish to use {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.AtomicLongMap}  * instead. Note, however, that unlike {@code Multiset}, {@code AtomicLongMap}  * does not automatically remove zeros.  *  * @author Kevin Bourrillion  * @since 2.0 (imported from Google Collections Library)  */
