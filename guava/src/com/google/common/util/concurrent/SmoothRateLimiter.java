comment|/*    * How is the RateLimiter designed, and why?    *    * The primary feature of a RateLimiter is its "stable rate", the maximum rate that    * is should allow at normal conditions. This is enforced by "throttling" incoming    * requests as needed, i.e. compute, for an incoming request, the appropriate throttle time,    * and make the calling thread wait as much.    *    * The simplest way to maintain a rate of QPS is to keep the timestamp of the last    * granted request, and ensure that (1/QPS) seconds have elapsed since then. For example,    * for a rate of QPS=5 (5 tokens per second), if we ensure that a request isn't granted    * earlier than 200ms after the last one, then we achieve the intended rate.    * If a request comes and the last request was granted only 100ms ago, then we wait for    * another 100ms. At this rate, serving 15 fresh permits (i.e. for an acquire(15) request)    * naturally takes 3 seconds.    *    * It is important to realize that such a RateLimiter has a very superficial memory    * of the past: it only remembers the last request. What if the RateLimiter was unused for    * a long period of time, then a request arrived and was immediately granted?    * This RateLimiter would immediately forget about that past underutilization. This may    * result in either underutilization or overflow, depending on the real world consequences    * of not using the expected rate.    *    * Past underutilization could mean that excess resources are available. Then, the RateLimiter    * should speed up for a while, to take advantage of these resources. This is important    * when the rate is applied to networking (limiting bandwidth), where past underutilization    * typically translates to "almost empty buffers", which can be filled immediately.    *    * On the other hand, past underutilization could mean that "the server responsible for    * handling the request has become less ready for future requests", i.e. its caches become    * stale, and requests become more likely to trigger expensive operations (a more extreme    * case of this example is when a server has just booted, and it is mostly busy with getting    * itself up to speed).    *    * To deal with such scenarios, we add an extra dimension, that of "past underutilization",    * modeled by "storedPermits" variable. This variable is zero when there is no    * underutilization, and it can grow up to maxStoredPermits, for sufficiently large    * underutilization. So, the requested permits, by an invocation acquire(permits),    * are served from:    * - stored permits (if available)    * - fresh permits (for any remaining permits)    *    * How this works is best explained with an example:    *    * For a RateLimiter that produces 1 token per second, every second    * that goes by with the RateLimiter being unused, we increase storedPermits by 1.    * Say we leave the RateLimiter unused for 10 seconds (i.e., we expected a request at time    * X, but we are at time X + 10 seconds before a request actually arrives; this is    * also related to the point made in the last paragraph), thus storedPermits    * becomes 10.0 (assuming maxStoredPermits>= 10.0). At that point, a request of acquire(3)    * arrives. We serve this request out of storedPermits, and reduce that to 7.0 (how this is    * translated to throttling time is discussed later). Immediately after, assume that an    * acquire(10) request arriving. We serve the request partly from storedPermits,    * using all the remaining 7.0 permits, and the remaining 3.0, we serve them by fresh permits    * produced by the rate limiter.    *    * We already know how much time it takes to serve 3 fresh permits: if the rate is    * "1 token per second", then this will take 3 seconds. But what does it mean to serve 7    * stored permits? As explained above, there is no unique answer. If we are primarily    * interested to deal with underutilization, then we want stored permits to be given out    * /faster/ than fresh ones, because underutilization = free resources for the taking.    * If we are primarily interested to deal with overflow, then stored permits could    * be given out /slower/ than fresh ones. Thus, we require a (different in each case)    * function that translates storedPermits to throtting time.    *    * This role is played by storedPermitsToWaitTime(double storedPermits, double permitsToTake).    * The underlying model is a continuous function mapping storedPermits    * (from 0.0 to maxStoredPermits) onto the 1/rate (i.e. intervals) that is effective at the given    * storedPermits. "storedPermits" essentially measure unused time; we spend unused time    * buying/storing permits. Rate is "permits / time", thus "1 / rate = time / permits".    * Thus, "1/rate" (time / permits) times "permits" gives time, i.e., integrals on this    * function (which is what storedPermitsToWaitTime() computes) correspond to minimum intervals    * between subsequent requests, for the specified number of requested permits.    *    * Here is an example of storedPermitsToWaitTime:    * If storedPermits == 10.0, and we want 3 permits, we take them from storedPermits,    * reducing them to 7.0, and compute the throttling for these as a call to    * storedPermitsToWaitTime(storedPermits = 10.0, permitsToTake = 3.0), which will    * evaluate the integral of the function from 7.0 to 10.0.    *    * Using integrals guarantees that the effect of a single acquire(3) is equivalent    * to { acquire(1); acquire(1); acquire(1); }, or { acquire(2); acquire(1); }, etc,    * since the integral of the function in [7.0, 10.0] is equivalent to the sum of the    * integrals of [7.0, 8.0], [8.0, 9.0], [9.0, 10.0] (and so on), no matter    * what the function is. This guarantees that we handle correctly requests of varying weight    * (permits), /no matter/ what the actual function is - so we can tweak the latter freely.    * (The only requirement, obviously, is that we can compute its integrals).    *    * Note well that if, for this function, we chose a horizontal line, at height of exactly    * (1/QPS), then the effect of the function is non-existent: we serve storedPermits at    * exactly the same cost as fresh ones (1/QPS is the cost for each). We use this trick later.    *    * If we pick a function that goes /below/ that horizontal line, it means that we reduce    * the area of the function, thus time. Thus, the RateLimiter becomes /faster/ after a    * period of underutilization. If, on the other hand, we pick a function that    * goes /above/ that horizontal line, then it means that the area (time) is increased,    * thus storedPermits are more costly than fresh permits, thus the RateLimiter becomes    * /slower/ after a period of underutilization.    *    * Last, but not least: consider a RateLimiter with rate of 1 permit per second, currently    * completely unused, and an expensive acquire(100) request comes. It would be nonsensical    * to just wait for 100 seconds, and /then/ start the actual task. Why wait without doing    * anything? A much better approach is to /allow/ the request right away (as if it was an    * acquire(1) request instead), and postpone /subsequent/ requests as needed. In this version,    * we allow starting the task immediately, and postpone by 100 seconds future requests,    * thus we allow for work to get done in the meantime instead of waiting idly.    *    * This has important consequences: it means that the RateLimiter doesn't remember the time    * of the _last_ request, but it remembers the (expected) time of the _next_ request. This    * also enables us to tell immediately (see tryAcquire(timeout)) whether a particular    * timeout is enough to get us to the point of the next scheduling time, since we always    * maintain that. And what we mean by "an unused RateLimiter" is also defined by that    * notion: when we observe that the "expected arrival time of the next request" is actually    * in the past, then the difference (now - past) is the amount of time that the RateLimiter    * was formally unused, and it is that amount of time which we translate to storedPermits.    * (We increase storedPermits with the amount of permits that would have been produced    * in that idle time). So, if rate == 1 permit per second, and arrivals come exactly    * one second after the previous, then storedPermits is _never_ increased -- we would only    * increase it for arrivals _later_ than the expected one second.    */

I.e., if our rate is    *    2 permits per second, and 3 unused seconds pass, we will always save 6 permits    *    (no matter what our initial position was), up to maxPermits.    *    If we invert the rate, we get the "stableInterval" (interval between two requests    *    in a perfectly spaced out sequence of requests of the given rate). Thus, if you    *    want to see "how much time it will take to go from X storedPermits to X+K storedPermits?",    *    the answer is always stableInterval * K. In the same example, for 2 permits per second,    *    stableInterval is 500ms. Thus to go from X storedPermits to X+6 storedPermits, we    *    require 6 * 500ms = 3 seconds.    *    *    In short, the time it takes to move to the right (save K permits) is equal to the    *    rectangle of width == K and height == stableInterval.    * 4) When _used_, the time it takes, as explained in the introductory class note, is    *    equal to the integral of our function, between X permits and X-K permits, assuming    *    we want to spend K saved permits.    *    *    In summary, the time it takes to move to the left (spend K permits), is equal to the    *    area of the function of width == K.    *    * Let's dive into this function now:    *    * When we have storedPermits<= halfPermits (the left portion of the function), then    * we spend them at the exact same rate that    * fresh permits would be generated anyway (that rate is 1/stableInterval). We size    * this area to be equal to _half_ the specified warmup period. Why we need this?    * And why half? We'll explain shortly below (after explaining the second part).    *    * Stored permits that are beyond halfPermits, are mapped to an ascending line, that goes    * from stableInterval to 3 * stableInterval. The average height for that part is    * 2 * stableInterval, and is sized appropriately to have an area _equal_ to the    * specified warmup period. Thus, by point (4) above, it takes "warmupPeriod" amount of time    * to go from maxPermits to halfPermits.    *    * BUT, by point (3) above, it only takes "warmupPeriod / 2" amount of time to return back    * to maxPermits, from halfPermits! (Because the trapezoid has double the area of the rectangle    * of height stableInterval and equivalent width). We decided that the "cooldown period"    * time should be equivalent to "warmup period", thus a fully saturated RateLimiter    * (with zero stored permits, serving only fresh ones) can go to a fully unsaturated    * (with storedPermits == maxPermits) in the same amount of time it takes for a fully    * unsaturated RateLimiter to return to the stableInterval -- which happens in halfPermits,    * since beyond that point, we use a horizontal line of "stableInterval" height, simulating    * the regular rate.    *    * Thus, we have figured all dimensions of this shape, to give all the desired    * properties:    * - the width is warmupPeriod / stableInterval, to make cooldownPeriod == warmupPeriod    * - the slope starts at the middle, and goes from stableInterval to 3*stableInterval so    *   to have halfPermits being spend in double the usual time (half the rate), while their    *   respective rate is steadily ramping up    */
