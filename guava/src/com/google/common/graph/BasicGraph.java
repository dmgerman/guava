In particular, when adding such elements to a graph, you should  *         create them once and store the reference if you will need to refer to those elements  *         more than once during creation (rather than passing {@code new MyMutableNode(id)}  *         to each {@code add*()} call).  *</ul>  *</ul>  *<br>Generally speaking, your design may be more robust if you use immutable nodes and  * store mutable per-element state in a separate data structure (e.g. an element-to-state map).  *<li>There are no Node classes built in.  So you can have a {@code BasicGraph<Integer>}  *     or a {@code BasicGraph<Author>} or a {@code BasicGraph<Webpage>}.  *<li>This framework supports multiple mechanisms for storing the topology of a graph,  *      including:  *<ul>  *<li>the Graph implementation stores the topology (for example, by storing a  *       {@code Map<N, N>} that maps nodes onto their adjacent nodes); this implies that the nodes  *       are just keys, and can be shared among graphs  *<li>the nodes store the topology (for example, by storing a {@code List<E>} of adjacent nodes);  *       this (usually) implies that nodes are graph-specific  *<li>a separate data repository (for example, a database) stores the topology  *</ul>  *</ul>  *  *<p>Notes on accessors:  *<ul>  *<li>Accessors which return collections may return views of the Graph. Modifications to the graph  *     which affect a view (e.g. calling {@code addNode(n)} or {@code removeNode(n)} while iterating  *     through {@code nodes()}) are not supported and may result in ConcurrentModificationException.  *<li>Accessors which return collections will return empty collections if their inputs are valid  *     but no elements satisfy the request (for example: {@code adjacentNodes(node)} will return an  *     empty collection if {@code node} has no adjacent nodes).  *<li>Accessors will throw {@code IllegalArgumentException} if passed an element  *     that is not in the graph.  *<li>Accessors take Object parameters rather than generic type specifiers to match the pattern  *     set by the Java Collections Framework.  *</ul>  *  *<p>Notes for implementors:  *<ul>  *<li>For accessors that return a {@code Set}, there are several options for the set behavior,  *     including:  *<ol>  *<li>Set is an immutable copy (e.g. {@code ImmutableSet}): attempts to modify the set in any  *         way will throw an exception, and modifications to the graph will<b>not</b> be reflected  *         in the set.  *<li>Set is an unmodifiable view (e.g. {@code Collections.unmodifiableSet()}): attempts to  *         modify the set in any way will throw an exception, and modifications to the graph will be  *         reflected in the set.  *<li>Set is a mutable copy: it may be modified, but modifications to the graph will<b>not</b>  *         be reflected in the set, and vice versa.  *<li>Set is a modifiable view: it may be modified, and modifications to the graph will be  *         reflected in the set (but modifications to the set will<b>not</b> be reflected in the  *         graph).  *<li>Set exposes the internal data directly: it may be modified, and modifications to the  *         graph will be reflected in the set, and vice versa.  *</ol>  *     Note that (1) and (2) are generally preferred. (5) is generally a hazardous design choice  *     and should be avoided, because keeping the internal data structures consistent can be tricky.  *<li>Prefer extending {@link AbstractBasicGraph} over implementing {@link BasicGraph} directly.  *     This will ensure consistent {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} across  *     implementations.  *<li>{@code Multimap}s are not sufficient internal data structures for Graph implementations  *     that support isolated nodes (nodes that have no incident edges), due to their restriction  *     that a key either maps to at least one value, or is not present in the {@code Multimap}.  *</ul>  *  *<p>Examples of use:  *<ul>  *<li>Is {@code node} in the graph?  *<pre><code>  *   graph.nodes().contains(node)  *</code></pre>  *<li>Traversing an undirected graph node-wise:  *<pre><code>  *   // Visit nodes reachable from {@code node}.  *   void depthFirstTraverse(N node) {  *     if (!isVisited(node)) {  *       visit(node);  *       for (N successor : graph.successors(node)) {  *         depthFirstTraverse(successor);  *       }  *     }  *   }  *</code></pre>  *</ul>  *  * @author James Sexton  * @author Joshua O'Madadhain  * @param<N> Node parameter type  * @since 20.0  */
